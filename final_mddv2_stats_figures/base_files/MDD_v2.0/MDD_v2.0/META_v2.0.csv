,otherCommonNames,other common names that have been used for the species as identified in literature; all names are separated by pipes (|) and follow the same format listed under 'mainCommonName'; these are usually restricted to English common names but common names from other languages are occassionally included when the name is widely used

E. Pavan, Mendes-Oliveira, & Voss); if the volume was described in a book or journal article with a differing set of editors/authors in the author line, an 'in' statement is used after the initial authors, followed by the editors/authors of the primary text (e.g., D. J. Kitchener in D. J. Kitchener & Maryanto); when two authors share the same surname, the initials are added before the surname in both cases, and if they share the same initials, then the middle name is also written out (e.g. J. A. Allen and G. M. Allen); for names of Chinese, Korean, and Indochinese origin, the full name is writen out with the surname put first and hyphens removed to match the format typically given in Chinese publication (e.g., Kuo Haochih, Fang Yinping, Csorba, & Lee Lingling)"
,authoritySpeciesYear,species authority: year that author first described the species as sourced from the Species_Syn_Current sheet

Thomas, 1900) as sourced from the Species_Syn_Current sheet; if a name is unavailable for any reason, the reason the name is unavailable is listed in brackets following the authority ; also noted are changes to gender if the gender of the name is changed to match the genus in which the species occurs"
