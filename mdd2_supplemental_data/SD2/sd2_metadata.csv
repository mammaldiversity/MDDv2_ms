File,Columns,Explanation
mdd_v2_synonym_sheet,,"all names applicable to species and subspecies level names; all species level synonyms within the Class Mammalia, which will match that of the online nomenclature database, Hesperomys (hesperomys.com)"
,MDD_syn_ID,unique MDD synonym identification number assigned to each synonym starting from '100000001' and increasing as new synonyms are added
,MDD_species,"the genus and specific epithet of the species that each synonym is assigned with a space between the genus and specific epithet, listed as 'genus incertae_sedis' or 'incertae_sedis incertae_sedis' if a specific name is not assigned to a species, specifically for nomen dubia, nomen inquirenda, and names with type material of composite or hybrid origin"
,MDD_root_name,"the specific epithet to be used as a root to form a valid taxon name from this name; the spelling of the name will be changed to match the generic gender if an adjective, or a name will be Latinized if initially written with non-Latin characters"
,MDD_author,"author last name(s) that first described the species, following typical guidelines for format with specifics listed here; all authors on the author line of the publication in which the species is described are included; a comma is presented after the second to last name if there are more than two authors (e.g., S. E. Pavan, Mendes-Oliveira, & Voss); if the volume was described in a book or journal article with a differing set of editors/authors in the author line, an 'in' statement is used after the initial authors, followed by the editors/authors of the primary text (e.g., D. J. Kitchener in D. J. Kitchener & Maryanto); when two authors share the same surname, the initials are added before the surname in both cases, and if they share the same initials, then the middle name is also written out (e.g. J. A. Allen and G. M. Allen); for names of Chinese, Korean, and Indochinese origin, the full name is writen out with the suriname put first and hyphens removed to match the format typically given in Chinese publication (e.g., Kuo Haochih, Fang Yinping, Csorba, & Lee Lingling)"
,MDD_year,year that author first described the species based on the original description
,MDD_authority_parentheses,0 for no parentheses around authority; 1 for parentheses around authority; values are based on the genus the species was included under in the original name combination as compared to the current genus name
,MDD_nomenclature_status,"the nomenclatural status of the name based on the ICZN Code; this columen will list if the name is avialable, whether it is a spelling variant or name combination, or the specific reason a name is unavailable (see Nomenclature_Taxonomy_Metadata for specific listing definitions)"
,MDD_validity,"the taxonomic status of the name based on the ICZN Code and primary literature; this column lists whether the name is a valid species or subspecies, or if the name is nomen dubium, nomen inquirendum, or if the name is based on type material of composite or hybrid origin (see Nomenclature_Taxonomy_Metadata for specific listing definitions)"

,MDD_authority_page,"the page number that the scientific name first appears in the original description citation; there are many niche situations which involve listing the page number in different ways, such as the name first appearing in a footnote, no page numbers in the text, or the name appear on a figure or plate, which is demarked in straightforward fashion in the sheet, generally in parentheses"
,MDD_authority_link,"a link to an online copy of the original description of the name; for older publications this is generally to the Biodiversity Heritage Library or other publication archives, with newer publications having a DOI linking directly to the journal website"
